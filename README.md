# Pezonic Ortholinear Layout

This contains some quick quality of life changes for my ortho layouts. Currently, just the Preonic Rev_3 is listed, but eventually the Planck will join in the fun.

## Preonic Layout

* **Layer 0** - The main typing layer, standard QWERTY. The lower left `Fn` key is changed to enable more robust RGB controls on Layer 1.
* **Layer 1** - This layer contains the RGB controls as well as print screen (`Fn`-`p`). I also have the arrow keys mapped to swap between a Number pad (Layer 5) and the QWERTY layout (Layer 1).
* **Layer 2** - Houses my media keys (which now include `Previous` mapped to the `<` key). The rest is pretty much the default.
* **Layer 3** - Default, but without any media keys.
* **Layer 4** - Default, but removing the Default Layer keys
* **Layer 5** - Number pad
